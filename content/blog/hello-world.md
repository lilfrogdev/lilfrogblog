Welcome to my blog post! This is where I'll share what I'm learning about development, security, and other fun things!

## What to expect

I'll be writing about:

- Vue and Nuxt
- Rust and Python
- Other fun things

## A code example

Here's some JavaScript to test syntax highlighting:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("world"));
```

Stay tuned!
